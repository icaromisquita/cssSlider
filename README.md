# CSS Slider

This repository contains the code for a simple, responsive CSS slider, deployed at [https://css-slider.vercel.app/](https://css-slider.vercel.app/).

## Overview

This project demonstrates a pure CSS implementation of an image slider, leveraging CSS transitions and transforms for smooth animations without any JavaScript.

## Technology Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and reinforced my understanding of the following technologies:

* **CSS Transitions:** I learned how to use CSS transitions to create smooth animations between different states of an element. Specifically, I utilized the `transition` property to animate the `transform` property, creating the sliding effect.
* **CSS Transforms:** I deepened my knowledge of CSS transforms, particularly the `translateX()` function, to move the slider's container horizontally. This allowed me to create the sliding motion without altering the layout.
* **CSS Overflow:** Understanding and utilizing the `overflow: hidden;` property was crucial for clipping the slider content and ensuring only the visible slide was displayed.
* **Responsive Design with CSS:** I practiced creating a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes using relative units and media queries.
* **Basic HTML Structure:** I reinforced the basic HTML structure for an image slider and how to properly structure the html to allow for easy css manipulation.
* **Vercel Deployment:** I learned how to deploy a static website using Vercel, which provided a seamless and efficient deployment process.
